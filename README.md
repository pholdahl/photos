## About the Project

The intended purpose of the website is to share vacation photos with friends and family in an engaging way by displaying them as polaroid photos on a wooden table. The user is able to pick up polaroid photos from the stack and look closer at them. The animations provide a near natural look of how the polaroid photos move when picked up and tossed back on the table. It is also possible to open the images in full view, which opens the images up in a different tab.

This version of the project is a further development of an obligatory assignment which was called "Summer Photos" from 2021. The current project includes several improvements that were beyond our knowledge and skillset at the time of the original project.

## Features

- **Dynamic Updates:** Images dynamically update from the database.
- **Upload Section:** New upload section allows users to upload new albums with photos.
- **User Login:** Includes a login screen for users (currently only one user, with potential for more in the future).
- **Interactive Polaroids:** Users can pick up and look closer at polaroid photos, making the experience interactive and engaging.
- **Realistic Animations:** Near realistic animations with gravity, inertia, and random rotational movements to simulate the natural behavior of photos being tossed.
- **Photo Layering:** The photo picked up always stays on top of the stack when tossed.

## Current State and Future Development

The project is still in development, with some issues that need to be addressed, these include:

- Automatic scaler and compression of uploaded photos
- Better scaling of website for different screen sizes
- Possibility to change background table and fontstyle
- Support for multiple users
- Comment section
- Share functionality
- Download functionality (to download all images from a specific vacation)

## Technology Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Supabase database
